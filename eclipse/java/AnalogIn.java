 * 
 * Demonstrate how to read an analog voltage value from an input pin using the
 * MRAA library, any sensor that outputs a variable voltage can be used with
 * this example code.
 * Suitable ones in the Grove Starter Kit are the Rotary Angle Sensor, Light
 * Sensor, Sound Sensor, Temperature Sensor.
 *
 * @hardware Analog sensor connected to pin A0 (Grove Base Shield Port A0)
 *
 * @req mraa.jar
