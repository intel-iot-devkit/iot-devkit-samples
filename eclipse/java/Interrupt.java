 * @brief ISR, interrupt service routine
 * 
 * Demonstrate how to react on an external event with an ISR (Interrupt Service
 * Routine), which will run independently of the main program flow using the
 * MRAA library.
 * Any button or sensor that can generate a voltage transition from ground to
 * Vcc or viceversa can be used with this example code.
 * Suitable ones in the Grove Starter Kit are the Button and Touch Sensor.
 * 
 * @hardware Input connected to digital pin 4 (Grove Base Shield Port D4)
 * 
 * @req mraa.jar
 *
