/*
 * IoT Cloud Analytics Example
 *
 * Demonstrate how to continuously send data to the IoT Cloud Analytics
 * (https://dashboard.us.enableiot.com/)
 * Read an analog voltage value from an input pin using the MRAA library,
 * then send its value to the IoT Cloud Analytics.
 * Any sensor that outputs a variable voltage can be used with this example
 * code. Suitable ones in the Grove Starter Kit are the Rotary Angle Sensor,
 * Light Sensor, Sound Sensor, Temperature Sensor.
 *
 * - analog in: analog sensor connected to pin A0 (Grove Base Shield Port A0)
 *
 * Additional linker flags: none
 */

/*
 * Preliminary Step
 *
 * Follow the IoT Cloud Analytics Getting Started Guide:
 * http://www.intel.com/support/motherboards/desktop/sb/CS-035346.htm
 *
 * Please check if the iotkit-agent is active on your device via
 *  $ systemctl status iotkit-agent
 * If not, activate it with
 *  $ systemctl start iotkit-agent
 *
 * Check the date of your device! It is this date that will be registered
 * in IoT Cloud Analytics.
