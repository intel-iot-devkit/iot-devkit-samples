/*
 * ISR, Interrupt Service Routine example
 *
 * Demonstrate how to react on an external event with an ISR (Interrupt Service
 * Routine), which will run independently of the main program flow using the
 * MRAA library.
 * Any button or sensor that can generate a voltage transition from ground to
 * Vcc or viceversa can be used with this example code.
 * Suitable ones in the Grove Starter Kit are the Button and Touch Sensor.
 *
 * - digital in: input connected to digital pin 4 (Grove Base Shield Port D4)
 *
 * Additional linker flags: none
