// libmraa is the library used to interface with the IO on iot-devkit
// platforms. You use it by including the top level mraa.h header in
// /usr/include and linking your application against -lmraa.

// Typically the compilation line would look something like:
// $ gcc myprog.c -lmraa
#include "mraa.h"

{
    // mraa gives you control of a gpio via a handle or context, we'll request
    // a context to represent io13 on our board
    mraa_gpio_context mygpio = mraa_gpio_init(13);
    // GPIOs require you to set a direction before you can use them
    mraa_gpio_dir(mygpio, MRAA_GPIO_OUT);
    // We'll store the value we want to write to our gpio here
