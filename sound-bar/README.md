# Sound Bar


## Introduction
This example show how to use a Led Bar to show ambient sound level. 


## Hardware requirements

[Grove* Sound Sensor](http://wiki.seeed.cc/Grove-Sound_Sensor/)connected to an analog port
[Grove Led Bar](http://wiki.seeed.cc/Grove-LED_Bar/) connected to digital ports for data and power

## Supported boards

This sample has been tested on
- Up Squared* board

The sample might need minor modifications depending on the board and shield you are using.

## Software requirements

The following libraries need to be installed on your target platfrom for this sample to work

[UPM](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/upm) & [MRAA](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/mraa) libraries

## Setup
Follow the steps listed in the hardware requirements section.

## Notes

Accessing device sensors, including LEDs, requires MRAA I/O operations. To avoid permission issues:

1. If you've already connected to your target, you'll need to kill the target tcf-agent and reboot the board before connecting with elevated privileges. More information is available [here](https://software.intel.com/en-us/developing-projects-with-intel-system-studio-c-creating-an-ssh-connection).

2. Connect to the target using passwordless (recommended) or with password-based SSH.

Passwordless Public Key-based Method (recommended):
First, generate the public keys. For instructions, see [Set up a new connection for your target](https://software.intel.com/en-us/developing-projects-with-intel-system-studio-c-2019-beta-creating-an-ssh-connection). 
Second, use the generated keys to connect to the target. For instructions, see [Login using public key](https://software.intel.com/en-us/developing-projects-with-intel-system-studio-c-2019-beta-connecting-to-target).

Password-based Method: 
Log in as the root user to connect to the target. For instructions, see [Authentication using password](https://software.intel.com/en-us/developing-projects-with-intel-system-studio-c-2019-beta-connecting-to-target). Because of security concerns, this method is not recommended.
