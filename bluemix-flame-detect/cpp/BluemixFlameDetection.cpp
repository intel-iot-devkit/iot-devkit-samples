/**
 * Demonstration of a IBM* Bluemix device client and application client communicating
 * with each other.
 * This project template is using the flame sensor to simulate fire detection.
 * The result is send through the device client to the IBM* Bluemix. The application
 * listening for the device topic will be notified when the message has been sent.
 * Depending on the result, the application will send a command to the device client
 * to turn on/off the fire alert. The fire alert will be simulated by enabling the
 * Grove Buzzer for some seconds.
 * 
 * Note: Publishing and subscribing to commands requires an account and is not
 * available with IBM* Quickstart.
 *
 * For instructions on how to setup the cloud service for this sample, see:
 * https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/iot-devkit-samples/blob/iss2018-update1/bluemix-quickstart/README.md
